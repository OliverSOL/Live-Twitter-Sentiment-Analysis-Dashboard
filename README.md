Key Takeaway: Businesses are using Twitter, specifically viral tweets, to increase traffic to their business listing on Amazon through giveaways, discounts, and small contests. The top three words counted are "free", "deals", and "win" (ignoring amazon, rt, and amp which are generic). Amazon is the largest e-commerce company and 22% of their traffic is attributed to its affiliate program, which comes from off the site.
