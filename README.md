Dashboard analyzes what people are saying about Amazon in real-time.

 



Key Takeaway: 

Businesses are using Twitter, specifically viral tweets, to increase traffic to their business listing on Amazon through giveaways, discounts, and small contests. The top three words counted are "free", "deals", and "win" (ignoring amazon, rt, and amp which are generic). This explains why about ~50% of all tweets relating to Amazon are categorized as 'positive'. 



From personal experience, users are paid to pin ads at the top of the comment section of their viral tweets in exchange for a free product or a discount. Amazon is the largest e-commerce company and 22% of their traffic is attributed to its affiliate program, which comes from off the site. Businesses that reach out to 'Amazon influencers' can market their products to individuals that are already within their same niche increasing the possibility of a sale and hence, increasing their bottom line. 



Now a' days, having your content go viral might lead to small partnerships with businesses that can exponentially grow. This is part of a full on trend in which businesses, big and small, utilize social media to grow their brand, take sports apparel brand Gym Shark, just valued at $1.3Bn. Or take Tik Tok star Charli D'Amelio who now has a successful partnership with Dunkin Donuts.
